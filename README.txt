One of my more effective teaching tricks 
(for graduate students) is to:

1. Give them a reference system in 
   a language they do not know, 
2. Then make them port that code to a 
   language that they do (e.g. Python).

By the time that is done:

- Students have a deep understanding of 
  the core principles invloved;
- Students know many of engineering 
  decisions that might need adjusting 
  when the code is used for real 
  application; 
- Students have the skills required to 
  make, and implement, those decisions.

So here is my reference system for my
standard data mining toolkit, written in a
language that it is **very** unlikely that
they have ever used
before.

Share and enjoy.
