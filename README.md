# Data mining, with LISP

<img align=right src="http://www.lisperati.com/lisplogo_warning_256.png">

One of my more effective teaching tricks 
(for graduate students) is to give them a reference system in 
a language they do not know, then port it to a language that they do (e.g. Python).
By the time that is done:

- They have a deep understanding of the core principles invloved;
- They know many of engineering decisions that might need adjusting when the code is used for
real application;
- They have the skills required to make, and implement, those decisions.

So here is my reference system for my standard data mining toolkit, written in a language
that it is **very** unlikely that they have ever used before.

Share and enjoy.

to get some interesting short cuts for LISP coding. See [source code](iva) for details.
