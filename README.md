For current details, see http://git.io/lisp. For an overview, see below.

Note that this code is currently 0.3. Still an itnernal hobby. 
But I promise to port it to asdf/quicklisp before version 1.0.

One of my more effective teaching tricks 
(for graduate students) is to:

1. give them a reference system in 
a language they do not know, 
2. Then make them port that code to a language that they do (e.g. Python).

By the time that is done:

- Students have a deep understanding of the core principles invloved;
- Students know many of engineering decisions that might need adjusting when the code is used for
real application;
- Students have the skills required to make, and implement, those decisions.

So here is my reference system for my standard data mining toolkit, written in a language
that it is **very** unlikely that they have ever used before.

Share and enjoy.
