# Data mining, with LISP

One of my more effective teaching tricks 
(for graduate students) is to give them a reference system in 
a language they do not know, then port it to a language that they do (e.g. Python).

Here is my reference system for my standard data mining toolkit, written in a language
that it is **very** unlikely that they have ever used before.

Share and enjoy.
